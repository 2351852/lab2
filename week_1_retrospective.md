| What the team did well | What went wrong | What the team could have done better |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Completed all user stories within the sprint | Several merge conflicts delayed the completion of some tasks | Could have done a better job of communicating updates and blockers during daily standups |
| Consistently met daily standup times | | |
| Effective use of project management tools | Scope of one user story was underestimated, causing delays | Need to improve user story estimation process |
